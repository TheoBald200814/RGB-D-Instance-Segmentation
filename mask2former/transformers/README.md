# Installation
To make sure you can successfully run the latest versions of the example scripts, you have to install the library from source and install some example-specific requirements. To do this, execute the following steps in a new virtual environment:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
cd transformers
pip install .
```
Then cd in the example folder of your choice and run
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
